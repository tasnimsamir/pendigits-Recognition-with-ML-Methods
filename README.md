# pendigits Recognition with ML Methods

Pendigits Recognition using three different ML Methods using Sklearn:
* Decision Tree
* Multi-Layer preceptron
* Gradient Boost

Steps:
* classification with all features and get the baseline accuracies.
* feature selection technique with k-best features
* update baseline accuracies
* Hyper-parameters tuning
* updata baseline accuracies
* using ensembling methods
  * Stacking the best 3 results
  * Random forest
* comparing all baseline accuracies
* plotting confusion matrix for the best 2 approaches.
